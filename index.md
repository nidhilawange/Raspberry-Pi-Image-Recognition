# Raspberry Pi Image Recognition
The intention of this project is to read an image, process its contents, and produce a description of the percentage possibility of several different objects being in that image. The image is taken by the Raspberry PiCamera2. I extended this project further than this original intent, but it has even greater applications.

# Second Milestone
  As a part of my second milestone, I connected the servo motor to the Raspberry Pi microcontroller board using 3 GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi board because the servo     motor requires 3 connections: the ground (GND - black), the 5 V supply (red), and the pulse width modulation signal (PWM - orange), which controls the clockwise and     counterclockwise movement of the servo shaft a certain number of degrees.  At this extent of the project, I wrote Python code for the servo motor to facilitate the       movement of the servo motor shaft from 0 to 180 degrees and back again.

# First Milestone
  As a part of my first milestone, I set up the Raspberry Pi, installed tensorflow (a library of machine learning models),    downloaded a sample machine learning model,   and configured this model to process images being produced from the Raspberry Pi Camera, which I also connected. At this point in my project, the Raspberry Pi camera     can take a static picture and the model can process the image, outputting the top 5 items of highest probability that seems to appear in the image. The final             achievement of this milestone is that the Raspberry Pi camera can now capture a live feed, which the model can process. Thus, any object that the camera is pointing at   in the live feed can be identified as the greatest probability match of the top 5 items. Find out what my next steps are in the video!
